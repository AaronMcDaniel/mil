# Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) library for Python


### Pending tasks

- [ ] Implement other algorithms, such as the SVM based ones.
- [ ] Make C++ extension of the APR algorithm to run faster.
- [ ] Make C++ extension of the MILESMapping algorithm to run faster.
- [ ] Implement get_positive_instances for MILES model.
- [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuner class.
- [ ] Implement Callbacks for using on Trainer.
- [ ] Add one cycle learning rate to use on optimizers of KerasClassifiers models.
- [ ] On trainer, implement to get the best validation loss for calculating the metrics, right now when evaluating a model, the metrics are the ones from the last epoch.
